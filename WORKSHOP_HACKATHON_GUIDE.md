## üèóÔ∏è Agent Development Framework

### 1. Basic Agent Template
```python

from integrations.mcp_client import MCPClient

class YourCustomAgent(A2AAgent):
    """Template for building your own agent"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(
            name="your-agent",
            capabilities=["analyze", "generate", "search"]
        )
        self.mcp = MCPClient()  # For LLM integration
        
    async def process_task(self, task_data: dict) -> dict:
        # Your agent logic here
        pass
```

### 2. FutureHouse Integration Example
```python
from integrations.futurehouse_client import FutureHouseClient

class ResearchAgent(A2AAgent):
    """Scientific research agent using FutureHouse"""
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__(name="research-agent")
        self.fh_client = FutureHouseClient(api_key=os.getenv("FH_API_KEY"))
        
    async def find_research(self, query: str) -> dict:
        # Use CROW for quick searches
        response = await self.fh_client.run_task({
            "name": "CROW",
            "query": query
        })
        return self.format_research_results(response)
```

### 3. Multi-Agent Workflow
```python
class TeamWorkflow:
    """Orchestrate multiple agents for complex tasks"""
    
    async def analyze_conversation(self, omi_memory):
        # Step 1: Extract key topics
        topics = await self.topic_agent.extract(omi_memory)
        
        # Step 2: Research each topic
        research_tasks = [
            self.research_agent.find_papers(topic)
            for topic in topics
        ]
        research_results = await asyncio.gather(*research_tasks)
        
        # Step 3: Generate insights
        insights = await self.insight_agent.synthesize(
            topics, research_results
        )
        
        return insights
```

        # Research each question
        research_results = []
        for question in questions:
            result = await self.fh.run_task({
                "name": "CROW",
                "query": question
            })

        # Synthesize findings
        synthesis = await self.synthesize_findings(
            questions, research_results
        )
        
        # Save to team knowledge base
        await self.save_to_knowledge_base(synthesis)
        
        return synthesis

# Run the agent
