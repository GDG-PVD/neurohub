uv run python agents/neuro_demo.py
```

### What Each Agent Does

#### 1. CogniWatch (Cognitive Patterns)

#### 2. SocialPulse (Social Health)
- Analyzes emotional tone
- Tracks social engagement
- Detects isolation risks
- **Real-world use**: Mental health support

#### 3. NeuroNavigator (Care Coordination)
- Schedules appointments
- Coordinates care team
- Manages medications
- **Real-world use**: Healthcare logistics

#### 4. BrainHealth Advisor (Personalized Insights)
- Generates health recommendations

## Part 2: Hands-On Implementation (45 min)

### Exercise 1: Analyze a Conversation

```python
# Sample conversation from workshop participant
conversation = """
[Your conversation with OMI device here]
"""

# Run through our agents
uv run python -c "
from agents.neuro_demo import run_neuro_demo
import asyncio
asyncio.run(run_neuro_demo('$conversation'))
"
```

### Exercise 2: Build Your Own Agent

Create a new file: `my_neuro_agent.py`

```python
"""
Template for creating your own neuro-focused agent
"""

class MyNeuroAgent:
    """
    Your agent description here
    Layer: [Semantic/Kinetic/Dynamic]
    Purpose: [What problem does it solve?]
    """
    
    def __init__(self, name: str):
        self.name = name
        self.layer = "semantic"  # Change based on your agent's role
        
    async def analyze(self, transcript: str) -> dict:
        """
        Your analysis logic here
        """
        # Example: Count questions to detect confusion
        questions = transcript.count("?")
        
        return {
            "agent_name": self.name,
            "analysis": {
                "questions_asked": questions,
                "confusion_level": "high" if questions > 5 else "low",
                "recommendation": "Provide clarification" if questions > 5 else "Continue monitoring"
            }
        }

# Test your agent
async def test_agent():
    agent = MyNeuroAgent("ConfusionDetector")
    result = await agent.analyze("What day is it? Where am I? Who are you?")
    print(result)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    import asyncio
    asyncio.run(test_agent())
```

### Exercise 3: Agent Collaboration

Design how your agent would work with others:

```python
# How would your agent interact with existing ones?
def design_collaboration():
    """
    If ConfusionDetector finds high confusion:
    1. -> NeuroNavigator: Schedule cognitive assessment
    2. -> DailyAssist: Increase check-in frequency
    3. -> BrainHealth Advisor: Adjust recommendations
    """
    pass
```

## Part 3: Ethical Considerations (15 min)

### Discussion Topics

1. **Privacy First**
   - What data should never leave the device?
   - How do we ensure user control?

2. **Assist, Don't Diagnose**
   - Why is this boundary important?
   - How do we communicate limitations?

3. **Inclusive Design**
   - How do we account for cultural differences?
   - What about language variations?

4. **Transparency**
   - How do we explain AI decisions?
   - What should users always know?

### Code Example: Privacy Controls

```python
class PrivacyAwareAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.privacy_settings = {
            "store_conversations": False,
            "share_with_family": False,
            "anonymous_research": False
        }
    
    def get_user_consent(self, action: str) -> bool:
        """Always ask before sensitive operations"""
        # In real app: Show UI prompt
        return self.privacy_settings.get(action, False)
```

## Part 4: Real-World Applications (30 min)

### Case Study 1: Early Detection
Sarah's OMI device + CogniWatch detected subtle speech changes over 6 months, prompting early intervention.

**Discussion**: What patterns might indicate concern?

### Case Study 2: Care Coordination  
Tom's NeuroNavigator helped manage appointments across 4 specialists, reducing missed visits by 80%.

**Discussion**: What other coordination challenges exist?

### Case Study 3: Social Support
Maria's SocialPulse identified increasing isolation, connecting her with local support groups.

**Discussion**: How can AI strengthen social connections?

### Challenge: Design a New Neuro Agent

1. **Identify a Problem** (5 min)
   - What neurological health challenge interests you?
   - Who would benefit from your agent?

2. **Design Your Agent** (15 min)
   - Name and purpose
   - Which layer (Semantic/Kinetic/Dynamic)?
   - Key capabilities
   - Privacy considerations

3. **Present to Group** (10 min)
   - 2-minute pitch
   - How it helps users
   - How it works with other agents

### Presentation Template
```markdown

**Problem**: [What challenge does it address?]

**Solution**: [How does your agent help?]

**Layer**: [Semantic/Kinetic/Dynamic]

**Key Features**:
1. [Feature 1]
2. [Feature 2]
3. [Feature 3]

**Privacy Approach**: [How do you protect user data?]

**Integration**: [How does it work with other agents?]
