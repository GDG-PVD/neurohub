# ADR-005: LLM-based Context Analysis

**Date:** 2025-07-24

**Status:** Accepted

**Deciders:** Development Team, AI Architecture Lead

**Tags:** ai, architecture, llm, analysis

## Context

The Context Analysis Agent needs to understand conversations, extract insights, identify intents, and provide summaries. This requires natural language understanding capabilities that are best provided by Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Decision

Use GPT-4 (or similar advanced LLMs) for conversation analysis within the Context Analysis Agent.

## Considered Options

1. **GPT-4/GPT-4-Turbo**: OpenAI's advanced language model
   - Pros:
     - State-of-the-art understanding
     - JSON mode for structured output
     - Good context window (32K/128K)
     - Reliable API
   - Cons:
     - Cost per token
     - API dependency
     - Latency for large contexts

2. **Open Source LLMs**: Llama, Mistral, etc.
   - Pros:
     - No API costs
     - Full control
     - Can run locally
   - Cons:
     - Requires GPU infrastructure
     - Lower quality than GPT-4
     - Maintenance overhead

3. **Traditional NLP**: spaCy, NLTK, etc.
   - Pros:
     - Fast and deterministic
     - No API costs
     - Well-understood
   - Cons:
     - Limited understanding
     - Can't handle complex context
     - Requires extensive rules

## Consequences

### Positive
- High-quality conversation analysis
- Handles any language or domain
- Structured JSON outputs
- Can extract complex patterns
- Continuously improving with model updates

### Negative
- Ongoing API costs
- Dependency on OpenAI
- Potential rate limits
- Privacy considerations for sensitive data

### Neutral
- Need to design good prompts
- Response caching recommended
- May need fallback for outages

## Implementation Notes

```python
async def analyze_context(transcript: str) -> dict:
    response = await openai.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4-turbo-preview",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": system_prompt},
            {"role": "user", "content": transcript}
        ],
        response_format={"type": "json_object"},
        temperature=0.3  # Lower for consistency
    )
    return json.loads(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

## Notes

GPT-4's capability to understand context and extract structured information makes it ideal for our conversation analysis needs. The cost is justified by the quality of insights provided.
