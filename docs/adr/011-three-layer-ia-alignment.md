# ADR-011: Three Layer Information Architecture Alignment

## Status
Accepted

## Context
The NeuroHub platform needs a comprehensive information architecture that:
- Organizes complexity while preserving context
- Enables seamless data flow across multiple agents
- Supports evolution and learning over time
- Provides clear user experience boundaries

The Three Layer IA approach provides a proven framework for organizing complex systems:
1. **Semantic Layer**: Captures fundamental knowledge units
2. **Kinetic Layer**: Documents process flow and movement
3. **Dynamic Layer**: Enables evolution and learning

## Decision
Align the NeuroHub multi-agent system with the Three Layer Information Architecture pattern to provide:
- Clear separation of concerns between data, process, and evolution
- Structured approach to agent responsibilities
- Framework for future extensibility

## Architecture Mapping

### Semantic Layer (Base Reality)
**Purpose**: Capture and structure fundamental conversation data

**Components**:
- **OMI Device Integration**: Raw audio/transcript capture
- **Memory Units**: Structured memories in Mem0 format
- **Context Extraction**: Semantic analysis of conversations
- **Entity Recognition**: People, places, topics, emotions

**Agents**:
- Context Analysis Agent (primary)
- Knowledge Agent (storage)

### Kinetic Layer (Process & Movement)
**Purpose**: Orchestrate data flow and track temporal sequences

**Components**:
- **A2A Protocol**: Agent communication patterns
- **Workflow Orchestration**: Multi-agent coordination
- **Real-time Streaming**: WebSocket data flow
- **Action Tracking**: Temporal deadlines and sequences

**Agents**:
- Gateway Agent (orchestration)
- Action Planning Agent (temporal tracking)
- Communication Agent (external actions)

### Dynamic Layer (Evolution & Learning)
**Purpose**: Enable system learning and adaptation

**Components**:
- **Memory Evolution**: How memories change over time
- **Team Learning**: Collective knowledge building
- **Pattern Recognition**: Emerging insights from conversations
- **Personalization**: Adapting to user preferences

**Integration Points**:
- Mem0 platform (memory persistence)
- Workshop teams (collective learning)
- Agent collaboration patterns

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Clear Architecture**: Each layer has distinct responsibilities
- **Scalability**: New agents map clearly to layers
- **Maintainability**: Separation of concerns improves code organization
- **User Experience**: Clear mental model for developers
- **Future-Ready**: Framework supports AI evolution

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Three layers add conceptual overhead
- **Coordination**: Cross-layer communication needs careful design
- **Learning Curve**: Developers need to understand the model

### Neutral
- **Documentation**: Requires clear explanation of layers
- **Agent Design**: Agents should align with layer boundaries
- **Data Flow**: Must respect layer hierarchy

## Implementation Guidelines

### Agent Development
```python
# Semantic Layer Agent Example
class SemanticAgent(A2AAgent):
    """Focuses on data extraction and structuring"""
    layer = "semantic"
    
    def process(self, raw_data):
        # Extract entities, meanings, relationships
        return structured_knowledge

# Kinetic Layer Agent Example  
class KineticAgent(A2AAgent):
    """Focuses on workflow and process"""
    layer = "kinetic"
    
    def orchestrate(self, agents, data):
        # Coordinate multi-agent workflows
        return process_results

# Dynamic Layer Integration
class DynamicIntegration:
    """Focuses on learning and evolution"""
    layer = "dynamic"
    
    def learn(self, interactions):
        # Update models, personalize experience
        return evolved_knowledge
```

### Data Flow Patterns
1. **Upward Flow**: Semantic → Kinetic → Dynamic
   - Raw data becomes structured knowledge
   - Knowledge drives processes
   - Processes enable learning

2. **Downward Flow**: Dynamic → Kinetic → Semantic
   - Learning influences process design
   - Processes determine data needs
   - Data collection adapts

## Alternatives Considered

1. **Flat Architecture**: All agents at same level
   - Simpler but lacks organization
   - Difficult to scale

2. **Microservices Only**: Pure service architecture
   - Good for deployment but lacks conceptual model
   - Missing information architecture

3. **Domain-Driven Design**: Business domain boundaries
   - Good for business logic but not AI systems
   - Doesn't capture evolution aspect

## Notes
This three-layer approach provides a conceptual framework that complements our technical architecture. It helps developers understand not just HOW the system works, but WHY it's organized this way.
